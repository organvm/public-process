## How to Contribute

### Finding a First Issue

1. Check the open [`good first issue` list](https://github.com/organvm/public-process/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22).
2. If no starter issue is available, open the [First Contribution template](https://github.com/organvm/public-process/issues/new?template=first_contribution.md) with a small proposed scope.
3. Good first contributions in this repository are usually Markdown, frontmatter, internal-link, documentation, or small Jekyll template fixes.

Maintainers should label starter tasks `good first issue` and include the relevant surface from the repository map above so contributors can tell whether the work is Markdown, Ruby/Jekyll, Liquid/HTML, CSS, YAML, or JSON.

### Reporting Issues

- Use GitHub Issues for bug reports and feature requests
- Use the provided issue templates when available
- Include clear reproduction steps for bugs
- For documentation issues, specify which file and section

### Making Changes

1. **Fork** the repository on GitHub
2. **Clone** your fork locally
3. **Create a branch** for your change:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
   ```
4. **Make your changes** following the code style guidelines below
5. **Test** your changes:
   ```bash
   bundle exec jekyll build --strict_front_matter
   ```
6. **Commit** with a clear, imperative-mood message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "add validation for edge case in parser"
   ```
7. **Push** your branch and open a Pull Request

### Code Style

Essays use Markdown with YAML frontmatter (title, date, categories, tags, excerpt). Follow the existing essay style: clear prose, specific examples, honest reflection. Filenames follow Jekyll convention: YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md in _posts/.

### Commit Messages

- Use imperative mood: "add feature" not "added feature"
- Keep the title under 72 characters
- Reference issue numbers when applicable: "fix auth bug (#42)"
- Keep commits atomic and focused on a single change

## Pull Request Process

1. Fill out the PR template with a description of your changes
2. Reference any related issues
3. Ensure all CI checks pass
4. Request review from a maintainer
5. Address review feedback promptly

PRs should be focused — one feature or fix per PR. Large changes should be
discussed in an issue first.
